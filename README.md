# 2262 Projects

A collection of projects made for LSU's Numerical Method's class, also known as CSC 2262

Fair warning, some of these might not work completely correctly, and I probably won't fix them, but I thought I'd keep them on the internet just to show my logic when I attacked these problems!

Anyways, here's what I gave the TA for the `howtorun.txt` file:

```
step 1:
install python

step 2:
go into a command window (terminal, cmd, powershell, etc)

step 3:
cd to the correct directory

Step 4:
run the command:
    python -u name.py (or whatever new name you or moodle gives the file)
```

So, now you know :)
